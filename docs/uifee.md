# UI Fees

- UI has gone offline?
- I haven't updated the UI with features in a while?
- Think you can build something better?

Fork this repository and keep building out and improving the UI. You can then deploy a instance of the app with your UI fee details (or I can transfer deployments of this repo to you) and participate in profit sharing.

You can configure fees to be paid in ALPH or any token of your choosing.

Update the following as desired:

<TODO>

And now you will receive the configured fee everytime someone uses your UI to create, donate or finalize a fund.
